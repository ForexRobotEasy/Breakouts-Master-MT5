# Breakouts Master MT5

This is the code for the Breakouts Master MT5 expert advisor developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This expert advisor is designed to identify breakouts in the market and place buy or sell orders accordingly.

## Description

The Breakouts Master MT5 expert advisor uses a simple breakout strategy to identify potential trading opportunities. It checks if the current price is above the previous high or below the previous low with a specified buffer. If a breakout is detected, it generates a buy or sell entry signal and places the corresponding order.

The expert advisor also includes risk management features. It calculates the lot size based on a specified risk percentage of the account balance. It also sets the stop-loss and take-profit levels based on a factor of the entry buffer to achieve a desired risk-reward ratio.

Additionally, the expert advisor manages open trades by partially closing them when they reach the take-profit level. It closes half of the trade volume at a specified buffer from the take-profit level to secure a partial profit.

## Usage

To use the Breakouts Master MT5 expert advisor, follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary libraries by adding the following line of code at the beginning of your script:

   ```
   #include <Trade\Trade.mqh>
   ```

2. Define the required constants:

   - `ENTRY_BUFFER`: Buffer for entry signals.
   - `EXIT_BUFFER`: Buffer for exit signals.
   - `RISK_PERCENTAGE`: Risk percentage for position sizing.
   - `STOP_LOSS_FACTOR`: Stop-loss factor for risk-reward ratio.

3. Create an instance of the Trade class:

   ```
   CTrade trade;
   ```

4. Initialize the expert advisor by implementing the `OnInit()` function:

   - Enable trade execution by setting the expert magic number.
   - Return `INIT_SUCCEEDED` if initialization is successful.

5. Implement the `OnTick()` function to handle the tick event:

   - Check if the current price is above the previous high or below the previous low with the entry buffer.
   - Generate buy or sell entry signals based on the breakout direction.
   - Calculate the lot size based on the risk percentage of the account balance.
   - Place the corresponding buy or sell order using the `trade.Buy()` or `trade.Sell()` functions.

6. Optionally, manage open trades by iterating through them using a for loop:

   - Get the current trade using the `trade.PositionGetByIndex()` function.
   - Check if the trade has reached the take-profit level based on the trade type.
   - Close the trade with a partial profit using the `trade.PositionClosePartial()` function.

7. Implement the `OnDeinit()` function to handle the deinitialization event:

   - Close all open trades using the `trade.PositionCloseAll()` function.
   - Print a termination message to the journal.
